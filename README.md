# webapp-sandbox-public
Public version of my webapp attack sandbox. This was a project for my Cybersecurity class in which I built a web application roughly mimicking web application features often seen in the wild. It was built (mostly) without security considerations so simple attacks could be demonstrated on the app.
The public repo has everything relevant from the private repo, it just leaves out some extra files that were necessary for hosting the code on Heroku.

Modifications needed to set up new instance:
1. Change PROJECT_ROOT and ALT_ROOT in includes/constants.php to respective roots of the new instance.
2. Change the database credentials in api/classes/postgres_heroku_db.php to the respective credentials for the new database.
3. Optionally, change hardcoded text (mostly in index.php) to whatever you want.

My version of the app is currently hosted on [my website](http://parkerniko.com/archive/webapp-sandbox/).

Note that single quotes (and probably some other sql stuff) breaks the sql query in the user registration page (and anywhere else, for that matter).
